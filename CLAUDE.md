## Workarounds for Claude bugs

- If pnpm commands give no outputs, stop and notify the user that the claude
  command should be downgraded
- use absolute path to modify files to avoid the error "File has been
  unexpectedly modified. Read it again before attempting to write it." on
  Windows
